Saying thank you can go a long way. A thank you note or email message, in addition to showing your appreciation, can boost your career, help you get a job offer, and cement a relationship with a client, vendor, or networking contact.

The Value of Thank You Notes
Consider your job interview thank you letters as follow-up "sales" letters. This is an opportunity to say why you want the job, what your qualifications are, and how you would contribute to the company. Your thank you letter is also the perfect opportunity to discuss anything of importance that your interviewer didn't ask or that you didn't answer as well as you could have.

When writing other business and work-related thank you messages and letters, keep in mind that every time you say thank you, you are not just showing your appreciation - you are also reminding the person you are writing to of who you are. These letters are great relationship builders.
